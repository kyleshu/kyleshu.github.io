abstract = {Cross-cloud data replication is vital for improving reliability and performance. Since cloud providers lack native support, users turn to open-source solutions that rely on VMs. However, these are slow to provision, leading to high replication delays and costs. We propose a serverless approach for data replication using cloud functions, which cut provisioning overhead from tens of seconds to just a few. While functions offer sufficient bandwidth, they suffer from performance asymmetry across clouds and variability among instances. Our system, $\lambda$Replica, mitigates this uncertainty through proactive planning and adaptive runtime adjustments. Prior to replication, $\lambda$Replica formulates an SLO-compliant plan. During runtime, it employs decentralized scheduling to manage slow instances and uses changelog propagation and batching to further reduce costs. Implemented on three major clouds, $\lambda$Replica outperforms existing solutions by reducing replication delay by 61\%-99\% with cost savings of up to three orders of magnitude. On production traces, it keeps p99.99 replication delay below 10 seconds.},

abstract = {Cloud block storage (CBS) is a key pillar of public clouds. Today's CBS distinguishes itself from physical counterparts (e.g., SSDs) by offering unique burst capability as well as enhanced throughput, capacity, and availability. We conduct an initial characterization of our CBS product, a globally deployed cloud block storage service at public cloud provider Alibaba Cloud. A key observation is that the storage agent (SA) running on a data processing unit (DPU) which connects user VMs to the backend storage is the major source of performance fluctuation with burst capability provided. In this paper, we propose a hardware-software co-designed I/O scheduling system BurstCBS to address load imbalance and tenant interference at SA. BurstCBS exploits high-performance queue scaling to achieve near-perfect load balancing at line rate. To mitigate tenant interference, we design a novel burstable I/O scheduler that prioritizes resource allocation for base-level usage while supporting bursts. We employ a vectorized I/O cost estimator for comprehensive measurements of the consumed resources of different types of I/Os. Our evaluation shows that BurstCBS reduces average latency by up to 85% and provides up to 5× throughput for base-level tenants under congestion with minimal overhead. We verify the benefits brought by BurstCBS with a database service that internally relies on CBS, and show that up to 83% latency reduction is observed on customer workloads.},

abstract = {RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks) has been widely adopted for decades, as it provides enhanced throughput and redundancy beyond what a single disk can offer. Today, enabled by fast datacenter networks, accessing remote block devices with acceptable overhead (i.e. disaggregated storage) becomes a reality (e.g., for serverless applications). Combining RAID with remote storage can provide the same benefits while creating better fault tolerance and flexibility than its monolithic counterparts. The key challenge of disaggregated RAID is to handle extra network traffic generated by RAID, which can consume a vast amount of NIC bandwidth. We present dRAID, a disaggregated RAID system that achieves near-optimal read and write throughput. dRAID exploits peer-to-peer disaggregated data access to reduce bandwidth consumption in both normal and degraded states. It employs non-blocking multi-stage writes to maximize inter-node parallelism, and applies pipelined I/O processing to maximize inter-device parallelism. We introduce bandwidth-aware reconstruction for better load balancing. We show that dRAID provides up to 3x bandwidth improvement. The results on a lightweight object store show that dRAID brings 1.5x-2.35x throughput improvement on various workloads.},

distributed cloud regions with reduced cost. A job is split into subtasks and placed
