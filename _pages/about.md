I obtained my Ph.D. degree from Peking University. My research interests lie in building scalable and elastic cloud storage atop modern network/storage hardware (e.g., RDMA NIC, DPU & NVMe SSD). Before that, I graduated from University of California at Berkeley with a Bachelor's degree in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science.

I am a foodie and enjoy making new dishes. Japanese, Italian, Vietnamese and Mediterranean are among my favorites. I am also a wine lover. I passed WSET Level 2 and may pursue Level 3 someday. I like Gew√ºrztraminer, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, and Pinot Noir.
